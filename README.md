# Record Shop

This app allows you to keep data of your record store conveniently.

Simply sign in or sign up, after that you will see the collection of records in your store. You can set them sold or available (sold records are displayed in the table in yellow).

You can add records to your collection either by filling the form manually or importing data from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) (one of the biggest music databases). To do that copy the release ID from Discogs and paste it in the form.
